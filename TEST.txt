Problem Statement:

Please design and develop a service that I can query that will yield the difference between:
 
1) the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and...
2)  the square of the sum of the same first n natural numbers, where n is guaranteed to be no greater than 100.

Example:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Requirements:

You should use Python and Django (any version of your choice).

I should be able to install your service by doing: pip install -r requirements.txt from a virtual environment.

I should be able to query your service at the following endpoint:

localhost:8000/difference?number=n where n is any integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

Your service should emit a JSON object of the following structure:

{
"datetime":current_datetime,
"value":solution,
"number":n,
"occurrences":occurrences // the number of times n has been requested
}

For persistence you can use postgres, mysql, mongo, neo4j, memcached, or redis.

Bonus (as discussed - highly encouraged):

Create a backbone application (or any other front end framework or just jquery) based on the above backend service.
That should display a list of the above values in the four columns described above (tabular data from JSON list?).

Your app should have a form to enter the number that you wish to query.
Be as creative as you want if you decide to take on the bonus section.

Delivery:

Please commit your code using either git or mercurial and use either bitbucket or github.
If you run into any issues, please contact me directly.

You have until 9PM on Wednesday to complete this task
